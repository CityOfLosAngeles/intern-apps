# DSF Research Assistant and Volunteer Projects
This repository includes an exercise for aspiring DSF volunteers and research assistants to complete. It will help us understand what skills you have so we can find the best fit and best project for you to work on as part of the [DSF](http://dsf.lacity.org).

Please do not spend more than 2-4 hours on it. Once you're done, please email [ITADATA@lacity.org](mailto://ITAData@lacity.org) with a link to your repository on Github. 

**For Data Roles** (data modelers, database people, data analysts, machine learning, etc): 

Please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository. You can learn how to do that [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. Download the a dataset from the City of LA [Data Portal](http://data.lacity.org) or [Geohub](http://geohub.lacity.org). Recommend datasets include Crime, Building Permits and City Budget 
3. Create a Jupyter notebook (using a Python or R kernel) or RMarkdown Document in your fork of this repository and that includes the following three (or four) sections:
  1. **Exploratory analysis**. Describe the dataset using counts, averages, frequency tabeles, and plots. Do you see anything interesting or potentially problematic?
  2. **A Data Story**. Find a specific interesting case in the data and tell us what happens with it. Provide evidence from the data that supports your narrative.
  3. **Questions for the Project Partner**. What questions would you ask the partner now that you have seen the data? What is missing that you might need to get from them or other data sources to do something useful with the data?
  4. **Modeling** (For those applying for machine learning positions). Build (and validate) a model with the data that predicts a quantity of interest, identifies underlying structure in the data, or explores a potentially important relationship among fields in the dataset. What did you learn from it? Why is it potentially useful or relevant to someone's decision making?

**For Software Engineering (Back-End or Front-End) Roles**: 

Please send us a link to a github repo and a working webapp that you've built. The best examples would be projects that either require user input (like an application system) or something that involves data visualization. Please include in your email a brief explaination of who the client/partner was and what their requirements were for the project as well as how you interacted with them.
